# F1 Manager Data & Strategy Hub

Built using Streamlit and Plotly just because I need more tools to help me with my F1 Manager save.

## Ideas

- Import/Export csv files of race data manually recorded by me/extracted from the save file.
- Pages showing race data from qualifiers, sprints & main race.
- Another page for showing team's pit stop time vs top 10.
- That pit stop time can be used with tyre compound + degradation time for strategising for upcoming races.
